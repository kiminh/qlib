# Framework of Qlib
![framework](docs/_static/img/framework.png)

At module level, Qlib is a platform that consists of the above components. Each components is loose-coupling and can be used stand-alone.

| Name | Description|
|------| -----|
| _Data layer_ | _DataServer_ focus on providing high performance infrastructure  for user to retreive and get raw data. _DataEnhancement_ will preprocess the data and provide the best dataset to be fed in to the models  |
| _Interday Model_ | _Interday model_ focus on produce forecasting signals(aka. _alpha_). Models are trained by _Model Creator_ and managed by _Model Manager_. User could choose one or multiple models for forecasting. Multiple models could be combined with _Ensemble_ module  |
| _Interday Strategy_ | _Portfolio Generator_ will take forecasting signals as input and output the orders based on current position to achieve target portfolio  | 
| _Intraday Trading_ | _Order Executor_ is responsible for executing orders output by _Interday Strategy_ and returning the executed results. |
| _Analysis_ |  User could get detailed analysis report of forecasting signal and portfolio in this part. |

* The modules with hand-drawn style is under development and will be  released in the future.
* The modules with dashed border is highly user-customizable and extendible.


# Quick start

## Installation

To install Qlib from source you need _Cython_ in addition to the normal dependencies above:

```bash
pip install cython
```

Clone the repository and then run:
```bash
python setup.py install
```


## Get Data
- Load and prepare the Data: execute the following command to load the stock data:
  ```bash
  python scripts/get_data.py qlib_data_cn --target_dir ~/.qlib/qlib_data/cn_data
  ```
<!-- 
- Run the initialization code and get stock data:

  ```python
  import qlib
  from qlib.data import D
  from qlib.config import REG_CN

  # Initialization
  mount_path = "~/.qlib/qlib_data/cn_data"  # target_dir
  qlib.init(mount_path=mount_path, region=REG_CN)

  # Get stock data by Qlib
  # Load trading calendar with the given time range and frequency
  print(D.calendar(start_time='2010-01-01', end_time='2017-12-31', freq='day')[:2])

  # Parse a given market name into a stockpool config
  instruments = D.instruments('csi500')
  print(D.list_instruments(instruments=instruments, start_time='2010-01-01', end_time='2017-12-31', as_list=True)[:6])

  # Load features of certain instruments in given time range
  instruments = ['SH600000']
  fields = ['$close', '$volume', 'Ref($close, 1)', 'Mean($close, 3)', '$high-$low']
  print(D.features(instruments, fields, start_time='2010-01-01', end_time='2017-12-31', freq='day').head())
  ```
 -->

## Auto Quant research workflow with _estimator_
Qlib provides a tool named `estimator` to run whole workflow automatically(including building dataset, train models, backtest, analysis)

1. Run _estimator_ (_config.yaml_ for: [estimator_config.yaml](example/estimator/estimator_config.yaml)):

    ```bash
    estimator -c example/estimator/estimator_config.yaml
    ```
  
    Estimator result:
  
    ```bash
    pred_long       mean    0.001386
                    std     0.004403
                    annual  0.349379

## Customized Quant research workflow by code
Automatic workflow may not suite the research workflow of all Quant researchers. To support flexible Quant research workflow, Qlib also provide modulized interface to allow researchers to build their own workflow. [Here](TODO_URL) is a demo for customized Quant research workflow by code



# More About Qlib
The detailed documents are organized in [docs](docs).
[Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org) and the readthedocs theme is required to build the documentation in html formats. 
```bash
cd docs/
conda install sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme -y
# Otherwise, you can install them with pip
# pip install sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme
make html
```
You can also view the [latest document](TODO_URL) online directly.



## Offline mode and online mode
The data server of Qlib can both deployed as offline mode and online mode. The default  mode is offline mode.

Under offline mode, the data will be deployed locally. 

Under online mode, the data will be deployed as a shared data service. The data and their cache will be shared by clients. The data retrieving performance is expected to be improved due to higher rate of cache hits. It will use less disk space, too. The documents of the online mode can be found in [Qlib-Server](TODO_link). The online mode can be deployed automatically with [Azure CLI based scripts](TODO_link)

## Performance of Qlib Data Server
The performance of data processing is important to datadriven methods like AI technologies. As an AI-oriented platform, Qlib provides a solution for data storage and data processing. To demonstrate the performance of Qlib, We
compare Qlib with several other solutions. 

The task for the solutions is to create a dataset from the
basic OHLCV daily data of a stock market, which involves
data query and processing.



Most general purpose databases take too much time on loading data. After looking into the underlying implementation, we find that data go through too many layers of interfaces and unnecessary format transformations in general purpose database solution.
Such overheads greatly slow down the data loading process.
Qlib data are stored in a compact format, which is efficient to be combined into arrays for scientific computation.
